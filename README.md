The following was an exercise in Python as compared to tcl/Tk. The amount of code 
was roughly the same. The syntax of Python is more concise arguably nicer to read
but less consistent.

Dynamic type checking with little type translations as in Python is a mediocre idea.
Dynamic type checking is good for debugging, but it is of little help and a meager consolation when a released 
program dies with a type check error and a traceback. TcL dynamic type translations from integer 
to/from float and string is much better. 0 must of the time is good enough in most situations for 0.0, False
and even None.

Python is significantly slower than bytecode compiled Tcl.

While I do not think that python is the best programming language I have ever used, I will continue to use it from now on.

It is extremly widespread, tons of useful and powerful libraries, trillions of code example ready for cut and paste 
in Google, Stackoverflow etc. Code runs on many platform, including Android and to some extent IOS.
Because of the widespread use and information available on the
Internet program development is much faster, especially for the beginner.


No way avoiding it. And despite some reservations a truly joyful experience. IÂ´d say 4.5 Stars and thumbs definitly up.
